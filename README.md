# Learning in Space: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for LEO Satellite Networks

This repository contains MATLAB code and supporting material for the paper:

**Learning in Space: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for LEO Satellite Networks**  
Sajad Saraygord Afshari, Peng Hu, Mana Zandvakili, Philip Ferguson

The code provides simulation frameworks, benchmarks, and reproducible experiments for applying **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** to three key challenges in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations: resource allocation, dynamic routing, and computation offloading. It accompanies the full manuscript (see `MARL_for_LEO_sats_survey_paper-4.pdf`), which surveys state-of-the-art MARL methods in this rapidly evolving domain[4].

## Overview

LEO satellite networks are a fundamental component of future global connectivity. They offer unique advantages such as low-latency coverage, resilience, and scalabilityâ€”but pose complex challenges due to their highly **dynamic topologies**, **limited onboard resources**, and **stringent quality of service (QoS)** demands. This repository supports the in-depth survey and case studies in our paper, showing how MARL enables more robust and adaptive solutions for:

- **Decentralized resource allocation**
- **Dynamic, delay-aware routing**
- **Computation offloading under mobility and energy constraints**

The open-source codes allow replication and extension of our simulations, enabling researchers and engineers to benchmark MARL algorithms against classical methods using realistic LEO satellite models[4].
